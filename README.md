# WoW-Classic-HiRez-Icons
High Resolution Replacement Icons for WoW Classic

These were created using Waifu2x and should not cause any sort of performance hit. The original style was kept and these should look nearly identical to the originals with just more defined edges.

How to Install:
- Download latest [master](https://github.com/psynct/WoW-Classic-HiRez-Icons/archive/master.zip)
- Unzip `master.zip`
- Copy the `ICONS` folder into `World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface`
- The directory tree should look like `World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\ICONS\**.blp`
